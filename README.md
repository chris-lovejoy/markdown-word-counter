# markdown-word-counter (Work-In-Progress)

The purpose of this script is to count all of the words within a specified directory.

At present, it only looks at .md files. It is well-suited for use with a tool like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

I created it to automatically log the amount of words that I write each day. I run this script as a daily cron job.



Potential improvements:
- Incorporating the *changes* in word. Sometimes I'll do editing of existing words, which is important but doesn't lead to *new* words being written
